                The home of our surf camp The Surfer Sri Lanka - Weligama was once just another sleepy coastal town, now is widely known as one of the Sri Lanka best beginner surf destinations.

                As you can see on the map, Weligama is a huge bay on the southern tip of the island, protected from the heaviest swells, making its waves soft and smooth, perfect for beginner surfing. Even when there are high walls striking through the reefs of nearby surf spots outside of Weligama Bay, you can still enjoy slow and easy beach breaks here.
                
                All along the shore, comprising beginner-intermediate surfing beach, you can find some of the top-rated Sri Lanka surf camps, thus best surf schools within 500 m distance.
                there is never a shortage of board rentals and surf instructors ready to bring your surfing to another level.
