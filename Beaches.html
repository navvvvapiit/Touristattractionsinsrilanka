                    <h3>Mirissa</h3><br>
                    <p>Mirissa is located in the south of Sri Lanka, between major cities of Galle and Matara. Initially, it was just one small street with a few accommodations and a roti shop. This now has become the popular beach hotspot of Sri Lanka. Nowadays you will find a wide variety of boutique hotels, hostels and cosy guesthouses here. There are also more than enough restaurants, beach clubs and coffee shops.

                        Mirissa is very popular among tourists. It can get pretty busy here. If you are looking for a lesser-known beach town with fewer crowds, consider going to Dickwella or Trincomalee. In addition, keep in mind that accommodations, especially the high rated ones on Booking.com or Agoda are sold out fast in Mirissa.

                    <h3>Nilaveli</h3><br>
                    <p>Is a stretch of beach which is situated approximately 16 kilometres North of Trincomalle, passing a thriving lagoon on either side and lush coconut palm groves and hordes of cattle, note that the people in the area are predominantly Hindu and consider the cows sacred. Arriving at the hamlet of “Errakkandy”, a sharp right turn will take you down a gravel road to Nilaweli beach, almost a kilometre of in lenght, white sandy beach with gentle surf. Across the beach about two kilometres into the ocean you will see the famous pigeon island, named due to rock pigeons roosting on it by the hundreds and crystal clear water around it to snorkel on to the clear depths of a reef. Further up North you will see a cluster of reddish rocks which are referred to as the red rock beach.

                    <h3>Galle Face Green</h3><br>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka, being an island, is known for her amazing beaches and views of the sea. However, in Colombo,it isn’t always easy to find a place where you can enjoy the crashing of the waves and most of all, an undisturbed view of the sunset. Galle Face Green thus attracts a large number of people, especially during the evening, although it is rarely empty, even in the afternoon when there is very little shelter from the scorching sun.
                        Galle Face Green (Galle Face Beach) is a half kilometer promenade in the heart of Colombo and was initially laid out in 1859 by Sir Henry Ward, Governor of British Ceylon. The stretch of land was used for horse racing and golf and was known as the Colpetty Race Course.
